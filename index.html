            <p style="font-size: inherit; text-align: justify;">
                My name is Aniruddha Mukherjee, and I am a Master of Science (MS) student in Computer Science at 
                <a href="https://www.purdue.edu" style="color:rgb(0, 90, 255); text-decoration: none" target="_blank">Purdue University</a>, West Lafayette, Indiana. 
                I am working on my thesis under the guidance of Professor Aniket Bera, focusing on modeling the diffusion of emotions over networks using the 
                state-of-the-art transformer models. I am also a member of the 
                <a href="https://ideas.cs.purdue.edu" style="color:rgb(0, 90, 255); text-decoration: none" target="_blank">IDEAS Lab</a>, 
                led by Professor Aniket Bera, where I have been actively involved in 
                various research projects since Fall 2022. My research interests and skills include machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. 
                Furthermore, I am very interested in quantum computing and have taken several advanced courses in quantum computing and technology.

            <p style="font-size: inherit; text-align: justify;">
                Before joining Purdue University, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree jointly majoring in Computer Science and Statistics from the 
                <a href="https://illinois.edu" style="color:rgb(0, 90, 255); text-decoration: none" target="_blank">University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign</a>.
                During my undergraduate studies, I also obtained minor degrees in Business Administration from the Geis College of Business, 
                Economics with a concentration in Econometrics from the department of Economics, and 
                Computational Engineering from the Grainger College of Engineering, as well as a Data Science certificate from the department of Statistics. 
                Additionally, I have earned online certificates in Machine Learning from Stanford University, taught by Professor Andrew Ng, and 
                Financial Markets from Yale University, taught by Professor Robert Shiller.

            <p style="font: inherit; text-align: justify;">
                I had the opportunity to work as a Software Development Intern at Mercury Systems, where I worked on developing embedded 
                software for aerial vehicles using C/C++, Assembly, Python, and Green Hills Software's products, such as Integrity RTOS and MULTI IDE. 
                I took the initiative to design and implement the controller system architecture for an Arduino-based test platform, adhering to best practices 
                and industry standards. Additionally, I created an automated code validation system using Python, LDRA, Bitbucket, and Jenkins. 
                This system was designed to detect code changes, identify the user and branch, and apply LDRA tools to ensure code quality and compliance. 
                I also developed an automated hexadecimal to voltage converter for Arduino systems, utilizing Python and serial communication protocols. 
                My role extended beyond technical tasks, as I led presentations for several projects, showcasing my leadership and communication skills. 
                Following a successful summer internship, I was offered a part-time remote working position by Mercury Systems, which I am currently undertaking 
                alongside my Masters degree at Purdue. This experience has been instrumental in shaping my professional journey and equipping me with the practical 
                skills needed in the field.

            <p style="font-size: inherit; text-align: justify;">
                Besides my academic, research, and industry achievements, I also possess various soft skills that make me a well-rounded and versatile individual. 
                I have excellent problem-solving and analytical skills, as demonstrated by my FIFA 2018 World Cup predictions project in my 
                <a href="https://aniruddhamukherjeesite.wordpress.com/summary-of-group-stage-matches/" style="color:rgb(0, 90, 255); text-decoration: none" target="_blank">hobby website</a>.
                In this project, I used machine learning techniques to predict the outcomes of the matches and achieved an accuracy of 65%. 
                I also have strong leadership and time management skills, as evidenced by my team's success in the Ashby Prize in Computational Science, organized by the 
                <a href="https://ai.ncsa.illinois.edu" style="color:rgb(0, 90, 255); text-decoration: none" target="_blank">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a> (NCSA). 
                This was a machine learning project where we designed a model to predict the density of chemicals in the atmosphere. I worked collaboratively 
                and efficiently with my other teammates and managed to secure the third place among many competitors.

            <p style="font-size: inherit; text-align: justify;">
                I was born in Jamshedpur, India and I began my primary education in Mumbai, India. At a young age, I moved to Zaragoza, Spain, and completed most of my primary education there. 
                At the age of ten, I relocated to the United States and completed the rest of my primary, middle, and high school education. My schooling in the United States 
                was split between Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Champaign, Illinois. Throughout my schooling years, I had the opportunity to interact with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. 
                This exposure provided me with a unique perspective on the value of cultural and geographic diversity. I have also traveled extensively across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. 
                This understanding of diversity has proven beneficial in working effectively in teams comprised of members from different backgrounds. 
                My research experience has taught me that research is often a collaborative process. I believe that my diverse life experience will be immensely useful in my future academic as 
                well as work life.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: inherit; text-align: justify;">
                My multicultural upbringing has endowed me with linguistic proficiency in multiple languages. I am fluent in English, Spanish, Hindi, and Bengali, 
                which not only enhances my communication skills but also broadens my cultural understanding. In my free time, I am drawn to the exhilarating world of soccer,
                both as a spectator and a player. I also find joy in participating in cultural activities, which allow me to connect with my Indian roots and appreciate the diversity 
                of cultures worldwide. Furthermore, I have a keen interest in Business and Technology, and I often spend time reading about these subjects. 
                These interests not only enrich my personal life but also contribute to my professional development. Please visit my
