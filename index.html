            <p style="font-size: inherit; text-align: justify;">
                My name is Aniruddha Mukherjee, and I am a Master of Science (MS) student in Computer Science at 
                <a href="https://www.purdue.edu" style="color:rgb(0, 90, 255); text-decoration: none" target="_blank">Purdue University</a>, West Lafayette, Indiana. 
                I am working on my thesis under the guidance of Professor Aniket Bera, focusing on modeling the diffusion of emotions over networks using the 
                state-of-the-art transformer models. I am also a member of the 
                <a href="https://ideas.cs.purdue.edu" style="color:rgb(0, 90, 255); text-decoration: none" target="_blank">IDEAS Lab</a>, 
                led by Professor Aniket Bera, where I have been actively involved in 
                various research projects since Fall 2022. My research interests and skills include machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics, 
                and I am also pursuing advanced learning in quantum computing.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: inherit; text-align: justify;">
                Before joining Purdue University, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Statistics from the 
                <a href="https://illinois.edu" style="color:rgb(0, 90, 255); text-decoration: none" target="_blank">University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign</a>.
                During my undergraduate studies, I also obtained minor degrees in Business Administration from the Geis College of Business, 
                Economics with a concentration in Econometrics from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and 
                Computational Engineering from the Grainger College of Engineering, as well as a Data Science certificate from the Statistics department. 
                Additionally, I have earned online certificates in Machine Learning from Stanford University, taught by Professor Andrew Ng, and 
                Financial Markets from Yale University, taught by Professor Robert Shiller.

            <p style="font-size: inherit; text-align: justify;">
                Besides my academic and research achievements, I also possess various soft skills that make me a well-rounded and versatile individual. 
                I have excellent problem-solving and analytical skills, as demonstrated by my FIFA 2018 World Cup predictions project in my 
                <a href="https://aniruddhamukherjeesite.wordpress.com/summary-of-group-stage-matches/" style="color:rgb(0, 90, 255); text-decoration: none" target="_blank">previous website</a>.
                In this project, I used machine learning techniques to predict the outcomes of the matches and achieved an accuracy of 65%. 
                I also have strong leadership and time management skills, as evidenced by my team's success in the Ashby Prize in Computational Science, organized by the 
                <a href="https://ai.ncsa.illinois.edu" style="color:rgb(0, 90, 255); text-decoration: none" target="_blank">Natinal Center for Supercomputing Applications</a> (NCSA). 
                This was a machine learning project where we designed a model to predict the density of chemicals in the atmosphere. We worked collaboratively 
                and efficiently and managed to secure the third place among many competitors.
