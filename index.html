                    I am a Master of Science (MS) student with thesis in Computer Science at Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana. 
                    I am also a graduate of the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign, where I obtained a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree 
                    in Computer Science and Statistics, with minors in Business Administration, Economics with Econometrics concentration, 
                    and Computational Science and Engineering, as well as a Data Science certificate from the Statistics department.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;"></p>
                    My research interests lie in the areas of Machine Learning, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Algorithmic Development. 
                    I am currently a member of the IDEAS research lab at Purdue, led by Associate Professor Aniket Bera. My lab profile can be found [here]. 
                    My current research project involves developing novel methods for human activity recognition and anomaly detection using deep 
                    learning and computer vision techniques.

                <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;"></p>
                    At Purdue, I have taken advanced courses in Quantum Computing, Statistical Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, 
                    and Computer Networking. For a full description of the courses I have taken throughout my academic career, 
                    please refer to the section on education below.

                <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;"></p>
                    I have strong skills in programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, R, and MATLAB. I am also proficient in using various frameworks 
                    and libraries for data analysis and machine learning, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy. I have experience in working 
                    with large-scale datasets and applying state-of-the-art algorithms to solve real-world problems.

                <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;"></p>
                    I am hard working and sincere. I have excellent capabilities in working in teams as I can easily adapt to new settings and cultures. 
                    Part of my adaptiveness is derived from my experience of living in many different countries such as India, Spain, and the United States. 
                    I have traveled to many different countries and learned about their cultures and languages. I can speak fluently in four different languages: 
                    English, Spanish, Hindi, and Bengali.

                    I am interested in pursuing a PhD degree in Computer Science or related fields. I believe that my education background, research experience,
